# Credit Card Fraud Detection

In this project tutorial, we will be predicting whether a particular transaction is a Fraudulent transaction or Genuine transaction. We will be dealing with data imbalance with the help of upsampling and downsampling using resample and SMOTE. We will dive into the BFSI industry, i.e. Banking, Financial Services, and the Insurance Industry.

We will be using different algorithms and models to arrive at our answer. Example:

K-Nearest Neighbour,\
Logistic Regression,\
Support Vector Machine,\
Random Forest Classifier,\
Naive Bayes,\
GridSearchCV,\
AUC,\
XGBoost
